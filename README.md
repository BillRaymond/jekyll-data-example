This is a vanilla Jekyll website using the default _minima_ theme. The site is published using GitHub Pages here. Just click the two links when you visit the site.

## Using built-in Jekyll data
In the root folder of this repo, locate the _jekyll-data.html_ file. In there you will learn how to:

* Access blog posts and related metadata
* Access pages and related metadata
* Access the _config.yml file

## Using custom Jekyll data
Jekyll allows you to access data from CSV, TSV, JSON, and YAML (YML) files. In the root of this folder, ocate the _custom-data.html_ file. In there, you will learn how to:

* Access data from a CSV file
* Access data from a TSV file
* Access data from a JSON file
* Access data from a YML file

In the root folder of this repo, locate the _data folder and you will find examples of each file type that the custom-data.html reads from.
